smelting metals is hard but the romans did it with copper, and they had plumbing.
 They had these things millions or thousands of years ago. Those estimates are probably wrong,
but the factual part of this statement is there was an ancient civilization that had these two
very nice features of modernity. As a modern human it made me mad to realize we take these
 features for granted. What other features of modernity do we take for granted? and if we can
take them for granted so easily should they be easy to do? should we not able to smelt our own
ores as easily as we repair a kitchen sink or a broken toilet?

As citizens of modernity I call you to action

go to your local hardware store buy things to melt down copper

This call to action is two parts:
1. shit on the past, we are better than the people who came before us and are now dead
(that's right grandma)

2. Give respect to the past and those who suffered before us
(it is abusive to the memory of those who came before us to not do what they could only think of)

This introduction has been give to show the 'why' of why I a grown adult who does not live with
 his parents strained said relationship with said parents by repeatedly attempting to smelt
copper in their backyard.
